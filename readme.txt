A configurable lightbox with EXIF support that works with native Wordpress galleries and images.

== Description ==

Acclectic Lightbox is an advanced and configurable lightbox that displays images and photos in your Wordpress galleries 
in full screen, complete with file information and EXIF metadata. Unlike most existing lightboxes, it supports native 
Wordpress galleries and images, so it will always work and you need not be dependent on third-party gallery plugins. It
is also highly configurable, and gives you control over almost every aspect of the lightbox's look and feel.

== Features ==

**EXIF**
Displays EXIF metadata for each image (if it is available) such as aperture, shutter speed, exposure (and many other 
tags). You can enable the display of EXIF metadata for each gallery.

**Configuration**
You can configure the lightbox directly within the Wordpress block editor. Each image and gallery can have a 
separate and different configuration.

**Slider**
Scroll through every image in the gallery using the built-in slider.

**Fullscreen**
Switch between full-screen and normal views with a convenient mouse or key press.

**Slideshow**
The lightbox can scroll through images automatically in a slideshow mode. The time between transitions is fully
configurable from within the block editor, and can be set per gallery.

**Keyboard bindings**
You can control all of the lightbox's features via the mouse or the keyboard. Scroll through images, play or pause the
slideshow, or toggle full-screen view with convenient key bindings.
